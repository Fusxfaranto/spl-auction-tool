spl-auction-tool
================

Web-based auction system for leagues to bid on players (i.e. SPL auction)

It's not really prepared for use, but it should work if you have all the dependencies (there aren't many) and a database.db file with the appropriate schemas.
It's mostly just up here for reference, since nobody seemed to find in useful, but if anyone wants it set up, just shoot me an email or something and I can get it a bit more prepared.
